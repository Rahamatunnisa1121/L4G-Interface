The L4G Payment Link Generator is a dynamic web application that leverages API integration to create seamless and efficient payment link generation. Users can input their name, email, and phone number into the system. Upon submission, the application uses a POST request to generate a payment link via an external API. This link is then delivered to the user's email address and phone number through SMS.
The project highlights include:
API Integration: Efficient handling of GET and POST requests for real-time link generation and delivery.
User Interface: A simple, user-friendly web form to collect user details.
Error Handling: Robust error display for failed requests and clear success messages for successful operations.
Technology Stack: Built using ReactJS and Axios for API communication.
This project demonstrates the practical use of APIs in creating a functional, user-centric application with real-world payment solutions.
